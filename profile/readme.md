# Welcome to McKeeBase
## Basecamp Lab developing solutions for 21st Century Digital Healthcare

### üë©‚Äç Some projects we are working on:
* [GenOCEANIC](https://github.com/mckeebase/genoceanic) - an open standards [openEHR](https://openehr.org/) approach to Genomics test ordering
* [GenTest](https://github.com/mckeebase/test-dir-architecture) - a re-architecturing of the NHSE Genomic Test Directory

### üëÄ Projects we are watching with interest:
* [PedigreeJS](https://github.com/CCGE-BOADICEA/pedigreejs) - a javascript tool for rendering pedigrees (as used in [CanRisk](https://canrisk.org/))
* [Medical Markdown](https://github.com/open-health-hub/medical-markdown) - exploring ways of making clinical noting fast and easy in the digital age
* [PhenoScore](https://github.com/ldingemans/PhenoScore) - open source project using AI to enhance variant interpretation in rare genetic disorders

### üí° Unmet needs? - ideas welcome!
* Easy pedigree notation and editing in plain text boxes (focus back on the keyboard rather than chasing a mouse around a screen)
* Pedigree parsing to rapidly convert between different formats
* Standalone phenotype picker that generates a text output that can be consumed by an EHR or CDS app
